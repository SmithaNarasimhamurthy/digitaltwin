# digitaltwin
A data-driven digital twin is a virtual model that replicates the behavior, condition, or characteristics of a real-world system or entity using datasets rather than physical sensor streams. Instead of modeling physical machinery or environments, it models dynamic data profiles — such as a patient’s health status.
